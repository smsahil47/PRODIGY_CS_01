# PRODIGY_CS_01
 # CAESAR_CIPHER_GUI
This project involves creating a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts characters by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

Features:
Encrypt a message by shifting characters by a specified amount.
Decrypt a message by reversing the shift.
Allow the user to input:
A message.
A shift value (number of positions to shift the characters).
